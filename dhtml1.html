	<h1>DHTML</h1>
	<p>DHTML stands for Dynamic HTML</p>
	<p>DHTML allows different scripting languages in a webpage.
        DHTML is used to create interactive and animated web pages that are generated in real time, 
        also known as dynmic web pages so that when such a page is accessed, the code within the 
        page is analyzed on the web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's web server.
       </p>
